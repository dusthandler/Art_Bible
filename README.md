## What is an "Art Bible"

Also called "Style Guide" is a document that contains the color schemes, the style, the interface, the process of creating the assets ... In short, a document that explains the visuals and how they will be produced.

### “What is the game?”

This is one the most frequent question that you and your team will consider during the beginning of video game creation.
There is more than one way to  answer this question but one of the most important aspect to look for is the __Game Pillars__.

The foundations of a games are known as __game pillars__ also knwon as basis of the game.

Sometimes people thinks that __game pillars__ and concepts like __Unique Selling Points__ are the same, but they are not.

__Game basis__ (Game Design Pillars) are the first concepts every videogame need. In general, there are an average of 3 - 8 primary and fundamental concepts that every game wants and need to be based on. Those also act as filters to discard new ideas during the development.

Every company, developer or game has a different set of game pillars, depending of what concepts they want to base their game. All the projects start with a set of concepts, game pillars, in which everyone in the developing group will __agree, support and design around__, in order to develop the game together as a team with the same objective.

It should also be clear that your game pillars must be __"your first and last stop for the game design decisions".__


# Which Game Pillars were defined in professional games ?

#### Five general concepts of game pillars (Team based):
![](https://github.com/AleixCas95/Game-Pillars/blob/master/docs/conceptsgamepillars.png?raw=true)


As already mentioned before, every videogame has a diferent set of game pillars. 
Most of the cases each professional game, each videogame development process has a __GDD__ (__Game Design Document__), that is created and edited by the development team (in our case will be the designer of the game) to  use it as a guide of the general vision during the game development process.

#### An example how important is the GDD:

## Example of the Game Pillars in a professional games:


Every professional game has his own game pillars, therefore we can not make a set of game pillars as standards but here you can find some example of a game pillars from __well-known games__:

### Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

![](https://github.com/AleixCas95/Game-Pillars/blob/master/docs/Zelda.jpg?raw=true)

__Exploration:__ Player are encouraged to explore, by being able to go to any area they wish whenever they wish.

__Traversal movement:__  Breath of the Wild offers so many modes of transport, each being as fun as one another. From, climbing, swimming, running, paragliding to the amazing shield surfing.

__Scavenging:__ Players are constantly needing to go through the world and search for items. From weapons which break after a few battles, to the food players must use to regain health or help them traverse through all kind of environmental hazards.

__Options:__ This game is praised all around for a number of options that are given to the player. From multiple ways to solve puzzles to the combat scenarios or how the player makes their way around the world.

__Combat:__ Now you have loads of combat in this game and a number of enemy. Lesser pillar in a general opion but still fighting .

### The Last of Us:

![](https://github.com/AleixCas95/Game-Pillars/blob/master/docs/LoU.jpg?raw=true)

__Crafting:__ Ammo is scarce, so to distract or cause a higher amount of damage to one’s foes it is better to use items populating the world. This works in unison with the environmental story telling of how this is not many resources left in this world.

__Story:__ Last of Us is a linear game which is heavily narrative lead, they want everything to tie in with the story as mentioned with crafting. The game focuses on the story of the two main characters rather than the player’s own story.

__AI partners:__ The game is all about building a relationship between the player’s character with the AI partner Ellie and other partners you meet throughout your journey.

__Stealth:__ Combat is used in this game, but if you were to run and gun, then the game would make your life extremely difficult. So player are encouraged to play more stealthily

### The Binding of Isaac Rebirth

![](https://github.com/AleixCas95/Game-Pillars/blob/master/docs/isaac.jpg?raw=true)

__Story:__ The Binding of Isaac Rebirth has a simple history like the original game, easy to remember and clear for all the players who play it and the one's who don't. Character crying who has to escape from his mother.

__Shooter:__ RPG shooter with heavy roguelike elements.(Dunegon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turned-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player character).

__Random factor:__ Although the history is always the same, the way is always different. A large amount of items obtained randomly across the game make the player feel a diferent gameplay every time he plays.

__Pause:__ Seems like something common but this remake has the option of pause. Being able to pause but not save makes the game less heavy if the player wants to make a runa pause is not obligated to play without being able to stop.


### There are some company's, studios with their own Game Pillars for all their projects.

##### Streamline Studios:

3 Pillars of Great Video Game Design

__1. Gameplay:__ 
"Is it possible to make a game so intuitive to play you jump into the game, and you’re completely immersed from the start? Maybe not, but I believe that should be the goal of every great game design. It’s truly a fundamental part of games that is often overlooked. People will talk story (so will we in a moment) and art and atmosphere when they discuss game design, but the gameplay makes the difference. Good gameplay design gets you into the game fast, and you forget about it. It’s seamless. What can be more fundamental and critical in game design?"

__2. Dimensionality:__
" Gameplay gets them into the game, but dimensionality propels the player into another world. The perfect balance achieved, and the player is barely aware of the game at all, the player becomes part of the game. To bring a player to this state, it’s important to understand all the elements of a game’s dimensionality must work together. Anything superfluous must go.

A great game can be a crude sketch, a simple world of 8-bit depth, but even in the most straightforward game the right dimensionality draws a player into the game and provides a memorable experience.

Let’s play that again; the greatest compliment a game designer can hear. "

__3. Concept:__
" When I was a kid, I started out in an advertising agency that was devoted to the Big Idea. The Big Idea was everything. It was  undeniable. It was unique. It set an impossible standard, but it served an exact purpose. Unless your idea resonated, breathed, had its own momentum, you shelved it and looked for another one. "


##### Paradox Game pillars

## Why we have to establish a good set of Game Pillars?

- So why is it important to figure this out? 

- Why do I need to limit my game to these amount of categories? 

These questions, together with the one is mentioned above, are the questions that are asked mainly when facing the start of the creation of a video game.

The answer to these questions may vary depending on where they are asked, but in summary, good game pillars form the __global set of foundations__ makes people work together, in the same direction and unanimously. It also serves as a guide as long as the project goes. Another good reason to make a good pillars is to avoid the last-minute inventions. (Not always are bad) However, these __pillars are not static__ so at some point and in a cohesive way they will be able to change throughout the project.
It is for this reason that every moment of the videogames development process, the game's pillars must be taken into account.




## What would be a bad game pillar and how to solve it  

![](https://github.com/AleixCas95/Game-Pillars/blob/master/docs/badpillarsimg.png?raw=true)

Once we know about what the ideal game pillars are, we can define __what could be bad game pillars__ and how to solve them:

1. Basing your game with __"it will be just another game"__. It must be a game that makes its own name. Your game must be unique, make players remember it for several reasons, like the gameplay, the mechanics, the history, or other factor/s that makes it special.

The __game must be fun__, a game that makes players feel bored and out of the game can't be a good pillar to be based on. Although, saying that your game will be fun is not enough, words are words and people can not be based them. For that reason, make sure that the concepts start with an unique and basic base that you have proven that they work.

__Simplify your ideas__, your game pillars can not be extended concepts that people takes its like a start, like "make a good UI", start with "create a functional UI" and move on from there.

__Expose your ideas__, make sure that all the members of your team understand what to do and what is the concept. Don't let people work without a clear or basic idea of what they should do or what are they doing every moment of the process.

Don't make concepts like __"it would be cool if the players could flys"__, if the answer to this is just, "because it would be cool" do not take it as a good example to: how base your game on.

## How is this useful for our teams ?

Using what we learned we can apply to our projects as a team and from a good base.
To create or design a good set of __game pillars__ we need to do it in a certain order:

- __First:__

We need to get ideas in common to establish what the game will be about and in which direction the team want to lead it.
Give simply general ideas, gameplay, mechanics...
Make 3 - 8 of that points your game pillars and start from there.
Make sure that you can afford or be close to afford them.

- __Second:__

While in progress make sure that the ideas are working and they fulfill the previously marked goals.
Don't forget testing it internally and make a general idea of how it's working every moment of the development.
Do not be afraid of the changes, if an idea can be changed for a better one, do not hesitate to ask and change it, as it is said, game pillars are not static foundations.

- __Third:__

Make sure that you are focusing the target you are oriented to, test the game and give you feedback to improve or reorganize your game.
